4001702025007,Bruder 02500 Ram 2500 Power Wagon 20.12.8,"
The Ram 2500 Power Wagon is, in the truest sense of the word, a ""heavy duty pickup truck"" from Ram Trucks. Its robustness and off-road capability are legendary and still unique today. This truck is also particularly impressive when it comes to performance. Its V8 HEMI engine produces 410 hp and 582 joule of torque. This powerhouse, with its striking Power Wagon design, is now available in the Bruder collection. Just like its full-size counterpart, the toy features a four-door cabin, the Crew Cab. All doors can be opened and provide space for four bworld figures. For driving comfort and off-road capability, this 1:16 scale model is equipped with suspended axles, and the front axle is steerable using the included steering wheel extension. The tailgate can be opened for load transport during play, and the cargo area offers space for Bruder pallets, wire mesh boxes, or straw bales (accessories 02415 / 02342 not included). The optionally available Light & Sound Module (accessory 02802) can be installed after opening the sunroof and further increases the play value.

Hardly any theme is more exciting to recreate than a major fire brigade operation. The new fire brigade highlight in the Bruder range is the Mack Granite fire brigade ladder truck. In addition to all the details, such as opening doors, folding mirrors, an opening hood and numerous chrome parts, the vehicle has an integrated water tank that is child's play to fill. The water hose can be wound up and held by the Bruder figures (e.g. item no. 60100, 60101 not included) or attached to the ladder basket and has a fully functional water spray. The turntable ladder with rescue basket can be extended and its height adjusted using a handwheel. In addition to two seats in the driver's cab, there is an additional seat for the Bruder figure on the fire brigade ladder. Four extendable support feet ensure that the vehicle stands securely in any situation and a large storage compartment with an opening door provides additional space for tools. The wide range of functions and the level of detail in the design mean there are no limits to the creative game scenes.

bworld is the Bruder play world. It consists of poseable figures, animals, accessories, and, most recently, theme sets, and is categorized into the well-known Bruder categories. Whether as a driver, rider, water sports enthusiast, in the infirmary, or motorcycle workshop, bworld items offer tons of fun on their own and are the ideal addition to the detailed vehicles. The theme sets immerse you even deeper into the Bruder world. Printed wall elements with easy-to-install adjustable feet now create a space for even more realistic play, and the new shelving system also allows for interaction with the elements.
UPS, one of the world's leading shipping service providers, offers its customers more than just parcel delivery. With the UPS stores, customers have the opportunity to take advantage of services such as print services, post office boxes, and, of course, UPS's worldwide shipping solutions. Bruder now also offers the UPS store with equipment and a figure. Packages can be picked up and dropped off here, shipping boxes can be purchased, and other services can be used. The employee included in the set is happy to help. The UPS store is the perfect addition to the UPS vehicles already included in the Bruder range, including Mercedes (item no. 02678), Mack (item no. 02828), and Scania (item no. 03582). And of course, the UPS Parcel Shop is easy to combine with the other bworld theme sets.

This type of work tool, known in technical jargon as a tracked dozer, is used for heavy-duty digging and clearing work, even in rough terrain, right up to fine grading. Bruder, as the holder of the international Cat® license for model plastic toy vehicles, is introducing such a model in 1:16 scale. In typical Bruder style, the tracked dozer recreates realism; it features a pivoting and tilting blade for all clearing and grading work, and the multi-tooth ripper allows for soil loosening even in the most difficult terrain. The real single-link chain gives the vehicle excellent running characteristics. The tracked dozer is another vehicle in the highly successful Bruder ""Small Vehicles"" range. With it, Bruder proves once again that high-quality toys, Made in Germany, are feasible at affordable prices and are highly valued by consumers.

For many people, motorcycling is a pure passion. Ducati, the premium motorcycle brand, has hit the mark with its Scrambler models. The Desert Sled is an enduro bike with studded off-road tires on wire-spoke wheels.

Forestry has been experiencing a renaissance for years thanks to the extraction of renewable raw materials. The numerous Bruder forestry vehicles are complemented by the Mack timber transport truck, which allows the extracted raw materials to be transported over long distances by road. Like its larger counterpart, the Mack truck features a loading crane mounted behind the driver's cab. The loading crane is equipped with a log grapple for moving logs. The log grapple can be locked in the open position. When a log needs to be grabbed, the log grapple is lowered onto it, and upon contact in the middle, the grapple closes automatically. This is an example of the functionality of this truck. Further highlights are the extendable and lowerable crane supports, as well as the chains on the stanchions of the loading platform used to secure the load. Of course, the stanchions can also be folded down for side loading of the timber. The truck can be unloaded from the rear by tilting the loading platform.

Whether as a driver, rider, water sports enthusiast, in the infirmary, or motorcycle workshop, bworld items offer tons of fun on their own and are the ideal addition to the detailed vehicles. The theme sets immerse you even deeper into the Bruder world.

The Bruder police force is gaining reinforcements and expanding its operational area to include water. To ensure operational readiness on all types of water in the future, the Bruder emergency forces are being joined by a 4x4 police pickup truck with a boat and operational diver.
The emergency vehicle is based on the well-known Ram 2500 and features a roof-mounted light and sound module. Like its full-size counterpart, the toy features the four-door Crew Cab. All doors open and offer space for four bworld figures. For driving comfort and off-road capability, this 1:16 scale model is equipped with suspended axles, with the front axle being steerable using the included steering wheel extension. The tailgate can be opened for transport during play.
The police boat with control console is a valuable tool in everyday police work thanks to its maneuverability and versatility, and offers space for up to three bworld figures. To ensure children can recreate missions as realistically as possible, the Bruder police boat is naturally buoyant and equipped with an all-round light.
Two bworld figures complete this extensive set. While the policewoman is assigned to drive the police vehicle and boat, the fully equipped police diver takes care of operations in the water.
As a complement and extension of the play value, the bworld police station (item no. 62732) fits perfectly with this emergency vehicle.

A fire service vehicle is essential for coordinating firefighting operations and minor emergencies. Thanks to its robustness and off-road capability, the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon is the ideal base for this purpose. The on-duty commander in his command vehicle coordinates the rescue and firefighting operations, but also lends a hand himself. The Bruder model, like the original, is equipped with all-terrain, suspended axles. The steering knuckle with a steering rod extension through the vehicle roof allows for the reenactment of emergency scenes. The doors, hood, and cargo area can be opened and quickly loaded. The firefighter figure can be equipped with the included accessories, such as a fire extinguisher and radio. The emergency light unit with siren on the roof clears the way during an emergency. In addition to three different siren sounds, the vehicle's engine sound can also be recreated. This realistically recreates a fire service operation in a child's room – ""Just like the real thing.""

The imposing Liebherr truck crane literally towers over the Bruder range of commercial vehicles. The truck crane is already a considerable size when fully extended and can be extended further with an additional boom. Our younger customers will be thrilled, as the crane stands 1.30 m high with its fully extended and erected crane arm, towering over even the smallest builders. Stability at this size is, of course, a must. The pivoting and individually adjustable support legs of the vehicle platform ensure high stability against tipping. For even greater stability, the attached counterweight can be used as with the original crane. To ensure sufficient weight for the model, it can be filled with sand. The Bruder slogan ""Multifunctional"" is particularly evident in this model. A developed cable winch with a locking mechanism and overload protection allows for effortless handling of the crane hook when lifting and lowering, even large parts. The attention to detail extends beyond the crane operator's cab. Like the original, it features a windshield protection frame and an opening sliding door. A tool compartment integrated into the platform rounds out the crane's many functions. The Mack cab is equally impressive. With its many chrome parts and large hood, it embodies the American way of life. A truck with many features, such as an opening hood and doors.

Robustly built, equipped with powerful engines, and boasting an above-average payload, this truck is the prototype of the much-described ""all-rounder"" with a host of innovations on board. The two-tone cab features opening doors, providing each bworld figure with a modern workplace.The entire loading and unloading process of the garbage truck is controlled by a unique rotary wheel mechanism, allowing two garbage bins to be emptied simultaneously. The flexible support console allows the same procedure to be used with the garbage container. The process: the garbage bins are pushed into the support console, and the garbage is then lifted into the hopper. As the wheel rotates, the garbage is then drawn into the functional compactor, compacted, and finally transported to the garbage bunker. This process is vividly demonstrated through a viewing window. The handle on top of the garbage bunker is used to tip the waste. By turning this handle, the garbage is transported to the rear via the discharge carriage, past the raised loading and unloading unit, and out to the outside. Two small garbage cans and treaded tires are included. To complement the play, the Man TGS garbage truck can be equipped with the garbage can set (3 small, 1 large) (item no. 02607).

4001702037673,Bruder 03767 Man TGS Truck with Roll-Off Container and Schaffer Compact Loader 24.12.8,"




The Man TGS is the perfect all-rounder for construction sites, long-distance haulage, and local distribution. Robustly built, equipped with powerful engines, and boasting an above-average payload, this truck is the prototype of the much-described ""all-rounder"" with a host of innovations on board. The two-tone cab features opening doors, providing each bworld figure with a modern workplace. The roll-off container has two pivoting wing doors at the end and can be lowered and picked up from the rear by the grab arm. When the container is on the ground and the doors are open, the smaller Bruder vehicles can even drive into the container and be transported by the container truck. This option is also frequently used on real-life construction sites, and young builders can recreate these flexible possibilities in their children's rooms. The ever-popular Schäffer farm loader is now included in this great combination.

4001702627331,"Bruder 62733 bworld Police Boat with Police Officer, Diver and Accessories 18.10.10","













The Bruder police force is gaining reinforcements and expanding its operational area to include water. To ensure operational readiness on all types of water in the future, the Bruder emergency forces will be supplemented by an inflatable boat with a diver.
The police boat with control console is a valuable tool in everyday police work thanks to its maneuverability and versatility. To help children recreate these missions as realistically as possible, the Bruder police boat is, of course, buoyant and equipped with an all-round light.
Two bworld figures complete this extensive set. While the police officer is assigned to pilot the boat, the fully equipped police diver takes care of operations in the water.
To expand the play value, the Police Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (item no. 02526) and the bworld Life Guard Station (item no. 62780) from the extensive theme world of emergency vehicles are particularly well suited.

4001702027384,Bruder 02738 Man TGA Cement Mixer 20.12.8,"












Our concrete mixer is based on the well-known and proven Man TGA. Its driver's cab is tiltable, allowing a view of the engine block. The drum of the modernized concrete mixer can be rotated using a hand crank mounted in the water tank. The drum contains a conveyor and mixing auger, and, like the original, the drum is emptied by reversing the direction of rotation. The auger inside the drum then conveys the contents to the rear of the discharge chute. Two attachable discharge plates are included. A bworld figure can check the mixer's operation by climbing the attached ladder. From the wide range of Bruder construction vehicles, this great concrete mixer can be combined with, for example, the Man TGS Truck with Roll-off container and compact loader (item no. 03767), as well as many other vehicles, to create extensive play worlds.

Construction equipment rental companies provide valuable support for both companies and private individuals when a machine is needed at short notice on a construction site. Despite a wide range of Bruder construction equipment, there may still be a small excavator missing from a sandpit construction site.
For this purpose, there is now the new combination of Ram Power Wagon with trailer and Bruder mini excavator.
The robustness and pulling power of the Ram are incredible. Like its larger counterpart, the toy features a four-door Crew Cab. All doors can be opened and accommodate four bworld figures. For driving comfort and off-road capability, this 1:16 scale model is equipped with sprung axles, and the front axle is steerable using the included steering wheel extension. For transporting loads during play, the tailgate can be opened, and the cargo area offers space for Bruder pallets, wire mesh boxes, or straw bales. The included trailer has a support for the drawbar, and the platform can be tilted using a lever for easy loading. The included Bruder mini excavator is fully functional; the bucket is removable and the dozer blade is adjustable. The mini excavator's boom can be angled sideways. Furthermore, the mini excavator's cabin can be rotated 360°, and it comes with modern rubber tracks. This great set can be complemented with the AUSA mini dumper (item no. 02449), the Cat® compact articulated wheel loader (item no. 02486) and many other great Bruder construction vehicles.
