# Per-site fetch specs

Each site has one spec file: `docs/sites/<site_id>.md`.

Generated by: `python3 scripts/analyze_site.py --site SITE`

The spec describes exactly how to fetch that site (URLs, HTML vs JS, selectors). After a spec exists, a dedicated scraper is implemented in `scripts/sites/scrape_<site_id>.py`.
